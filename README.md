# Fun_Word_dictionary_2
This project is a conversion of my first dictionary activity from Python to C++, where I use if-else statements to handle key-value logic. Alongside the conversion, I also compare how quickly I was able to write both versions and reflect on the differences in implementation. This project serves as a learning exercise to understand how Python's built-in dictionary features contrast with C++'s manual approach. You can find the full source code in the repository and try running the C++ version to see how it works.
